In the Push_Swap project we have to sort out a list of numbers. The numbers are passed thourgh the terminal and we have to use 2 stacks, a limited number of operations and the least amount of actions possible.

The project is evaluated based on the speed of the sort of lists with different lenght.

We create a struct that will how the value of each list, the next item in the list and the index in the stack

In Case Three we compare top to middle, middle to bottom, and bottom to top
