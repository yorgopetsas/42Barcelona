## About 42 Barcelona

	Rather than short training focused on a specific field or a coding language that will quickly 
	become obsolete, 42 offers its students the tools to quietly tackle the technological changes 
	they will face throughout their careers. In 42, students will “learn to learn”, thus developing 
	the ability to adapt and find concrete solutions to problems based on current knowledge and tools.

## Projects:
* <b style="font-size:25px;"><a href="https://github.com/yorgopetsas/42Barcelona/tree/master/push_swap">Push_Swap</a></b> -> In this project we have to use two stacks to sort a random list of numbers with limited kind of operations allowed using the least number of operations possible. 

* <b style="font-size:25px;"><a href="https://github.com/yorgopetsas/42Barcelona/tree/master/get_next_line">Get Next Line</a></b> -> In this project we have to handle a file and return the next line handeling with variable BUFFER_SIZE


* <b style="font-size:25px;"><a href="https://github.com/yorgopetsas/42Barcelona/tree/master/printf">Print_F</a></b> -> In this project we need to develop our own print_f function only using our code and the <stdarg.h> library for handeling arguments passed from the Terminal

* <b style="font-size:25px;"><a href="https://github.com/yorgopetsas/42Barcelona/tree/master/libft">Libft</a></b> -> Creation of the first own library with basic operations using only write and malloc


* <b style="font-size:25px;">Born2BeRoot</b> -> In this project we setup a virtual machine, create users, groups, password policies, setup FIREWARE, sudo, SSH access, a cron job, update hostnames and some other small settings. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> No code presented as the VM is 2GB.
